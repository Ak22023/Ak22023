- 👋 Hi, I’m @Ak22023
- 👀 I’m interested in dairy production and management. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how we can improve the microbial quality of organic based bedding materials. Bedding materials, although secondary to the udder of the cow, harbour and help spread environmental mastitis pathopgens. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on microbiomes in the bedding to better understand it. 
- 📫 You can reach me at akalate@uoguelph.cs
